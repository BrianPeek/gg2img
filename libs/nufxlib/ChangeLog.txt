2006/02/18  ***** v2.1.1 shipped *****

2006/02/18  fadden
    - Correct a wayward assert.  (Changing the filetype of a file from an
      HFS disk, which has zero-length data fork, falsely triggered the
      assert.)

2005/09/17  ***** v2.1.0 shipped *****

2005/09/17  fadden
    - Added "kNuValIgnoreLZW2Len" flag, which enables NuLib2 to handle
      archives created by an unknown but badly broken program.
    - Fixed build for gcc v4.0.

2004/10/11  ***** v2.0.3 shipped *****

2004/09/25  fadden

      archive would fail.
    - Removed use of a "ushort" from NufxLib.h.

2004/09/20  fadden
    - Corrected behavior after flush when original archive can't be
      deleted.

2004/09/09  fadden
    - Added header offset and junk offset to NuGetAttr.

2004/08/22  fadden

      when "fake threads" is enabled.

2004/03/10  ***** v2.0.2 shipped *****

2004/03/09  fadden
    - Set access permissions based on umask when extracting a "locked"
      file.  My thanks to Matthew Fischer for sending a patch.
    - Reject archives with a MasterEOF == 48, not <= 48.  There are
      some otherwise valid archives created by an old version of ShrinkIt
      that have MasterEOF==0.

2003/10/16  ***** v2.0.1 shipped *****

2003/10/16  fadden
    - Added workaround for bad HFS option lists created by GSHK.
    - Added junk-skipping feature.  Up to 1024 bytes of crud (e.g.
      MacBinary headers or HTTP remnants) will be searched for evidence
      of an archive.

2003/06/19  sheppy
    - Added support for resource forks and file and aux types when built
      for Mac OS X.

    - Switched to case-sensitive filename comparisons.

2003/02/08  fadden
    - Upped version to v2.0.0.
    - Changed DataSource API.  Removed "doClose" and added an optional
      callback function that handles releasing of resources.  Necessary
      to make Win32 DLLs work right with unsuspecting apps.
    - Changed DataSource "copy" function to use refcounting.  Still
      not quite right, but it'll do for now.  Memory leaks in DataSource
      handling appear to be fixed.  (I love valgrind.)

2003/01/10  fadden
    - Added version numbers to header.
    - Added kNuValueMaskThreadless to control handling of "threadless"
      records.  Now records without threads can be silently "fixed" so
      the application does need to handle them specially.

2002/12/06  fadden
    - Made changes to allow NufxLib to be built as a Win32 DLL.

2002/10/20  ***** v1.1.0 shipped *****

    - added support for SQueezed files (both compress and expand)

2002/09/23  fadden
    - ran the code through valgrind; found and fixed some minor bugs

2002/09/20  fadden
    - pulled the sources out and started fiddling with them again
    - changed hard tabs to spaces

2000/05/22  ***** v1.0.1 shipped *****

    - instead of constantly allocating 16K buffers, use pArchive->compBuf
    - ignore DataSink convertEOL value when doExpand is false

2000/02/01  fadden
    - added system-specific PATH_SEP define for samples (imgconv, exerciser)
    - set the pathname in ErrorStatus for CRC failures

    - don't remove the temp file if the rename fails
    - Nu_ReportError now optionally uses a callback instead of stderr
    - pass NuArchive* and all the trimmings into Nu_ReportError so we can
      do the callback thing; required adding arguments to lots of places
    - clearly labeled BailError output as debug-only, then replaced most
      of the BailErrorQuiet calls with BailError
    - added global error message for when pArchive doesn't exist (e.g. Open)
